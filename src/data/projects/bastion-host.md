In this project, you will create a Bastion Host on AWS and use it to securely connect to a private EC2 instance.

## Requirements

- Create a VPC with both public and private subnets.
- Create a Bastion Host EC2 instance in the public subnet.
- Create a private EC2 instance in the private subnet.
- The Bastion Host should:
  - Have a security group that allows SSH access **only from your IP address**.
  - Have a public IP address.
- The private EC2 instance should:
  - Only allow SSH access **from the Bastion Host's security group**.
  - Have no public IP address.
- SSH into the private EC2 instance via the Bastion Host.
- Implement at least one security best practice, such as logging or IP restriction.

## Optional Enhancements

- Use IAM Roles to restrict access to the Bastion Host.
- Enable CloudWatch for SSH logging.
- Automate shutdown/startup of the Bastion Host using AWS Lambda.
