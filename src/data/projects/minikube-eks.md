In this project, you will deploy and scale a Kubernetes application on both a local MiniKube environment and AWS EKS to simulate a complete DevOps pipeline.

## Requirements

- Install and configure MiniKube on your local machine.
- Create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EKS.
- Develop a simple, scalable application (e.g., a web server) and package it into a container.
- Deploy the application to MiniKube for local testing.
- Create a Helm Chart for the application.
- Deploy the same Helm Chart to your EKS cluster.
- Configure CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate deployments.

## Optional Enhancements

- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling on EKS.
- Set up metrics server in both environments.
- Verify autoscaling in response to load.
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualizing application performance.
- Implement Network Policies for traffic control within the EKS cluster.

You can learn more about setting up MiniKube [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and EKS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html).
