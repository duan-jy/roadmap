# AI Engineer vs ML Engineer

AI Engineer: An AI engineer develops systems that exhibit human-like intelligence, often applying a variety of AI techniques, including but not limited to machine learning. Their work encompasses a broad range of applications, from robotics to natural language processing, and they typically engage in tasks that require creative problem-solving and system design.

ML Engineer: A machine learning engineer specializes in creating algorithms and models that allow systems to learn from data. Their primary focus is on optimizing these models to improve performance through iterative testing and data analysis. They often work closely with large datasets to develop predictive models for specific applications like classification or regression tasks.
