# AI Safety and Ethics

AI Safety and Ethics are critical areas that focus on creating intelligent systems that are safe, transparent, and aligned with human values. AI Safety emphasizes preventing unintended consequences from AI models, such as harmful behavior or misalignment with human goals, by implementing rigorous testing, fail-safes, and monitoring systems. AI Ethics, on the other hand, addresses broader social implications like fairness, accountability, privacy, and bias, ensuring that AI technologies do not perpetuate discrimination or infringe on human rights. Together, these fields promote responsible AI use, emphasizing trust, human oversight, and adherence to ethical principles in the design and deployment of AI systems.
