# AI vs AGI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines designed to perform specific tasks such as image recognition, language processing, or decision-making, often surpassing human performance in narrow domains. These systems are specialized and lack general understanding outside of their defined scope. In contrast, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a theoretical form of AI that possesses human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating flexibility, common sense, and the ability to learn and adapt autonomously. While current AI excels in narrow applications, AGI aims to mimic human intelligence holistically, but it remains a long-term goal and a subject of ongoing research
