# Animations

Animations are visual transitions or effects that add motion to UI elements, making the interface more interactive and fluid. They provide feedback, guide user attention, and improve the flow between different actions. Animations can be created using CSS, JavaScript, or libraries like GSAP, ranging from basic hover effects to complex interactions.
